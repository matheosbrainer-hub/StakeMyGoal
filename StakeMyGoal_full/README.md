# StakeMyGoal - Demo Project

This repository is a demo front-end + placeholder back-end for the StakeMyGoal project created interactively with ChatGPT.

## Run Locally
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Add environment variables to `.env.local` (see `.env.local.example`)
3. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- API routes are placeholders and must be implemented with proper Stripe and Firebase admin logic for production.
- Components implement UI and client-side logic; Wire them to backend routes and Firestore for full functionality.
